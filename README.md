# Final-Year-Project
Final year project on modelling migration with machine learning on european data

This is the code to my final year project for Durham University

The aim for this project is to use data from UNHCR and World Bank Open data to create a model that can predict forced migration in countries. 


/code/Migration Modelling 2.Rmd gives us the full code in R Markdown with for chapters 1 & 2 

/code/Residual Analysis Summary.Rmd gives us the code for chapters 3 & 4

We split the code up due to computational cost of running all the code for unsupervised and supervised learning for testing models 

/code/Migration Modelling 2.Rmd should give the full jist of the topics in our code whereas 
/code/Residual Analysis Summary.Rmd refines and gives the diagrams in our report and also looks into more advanced models 
such as XGboosting, BART Trees. 

Note some packages may not be installed for all libraries we simply used the install.packages command to get them.
